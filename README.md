# GloveWearableApp
The private repo of my Final Grade Project<br />
The project consists in a wearable device (a Glove) that has some electronics installed on it: contacts in every finger tip, current regulators, an Adafruit Flora Arduino Board with BLE antenna, and a Lithium battery.<br />

The gloveApp running in Arduino is able to pair to an Android phone, and is able to record the touches that the user do with their fingers.
Once the touches have been recorded they can be linked to a related action that the phone can execute.

For this there are two parts on this project:<br />
    <> GloveRemoteFirmware: which is installed in Arduino Wearable board.<br />
    <> GloveRemoteApp: which is installed in Android Phones of 4.4+ Android version anb BLE supporters.<br />
